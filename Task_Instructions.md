Create a flashcard quiz app for studying. Users can:
- Each flashcard will have a question on the front and answer on the back, with a `Show Answer` button.
- Users can navigate between cards using `Next` and `Previous` buttons.
- Users should be able to `add`, `edit`, and `delete` flashcards for customization.
- The app should have a simple and clean user interface for easy usage.
